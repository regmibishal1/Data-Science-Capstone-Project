## Summary of methodologies
In order to get the data on the SpaceX rocket launches, data was collected using two methods. One consisting of web scraping Wikipedia pages on SpaceX launches using key terms to obtain desired values and another using SpaceX rest API. </br>
Given the data was collected, the data was first wrangled so that it was easy to work with using pandas and numpy libraries. This is where the missing values were cleaned up and the data was organized. </br>
Once the data was organized, the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process started by first trying to just use the data frame column manipulation and functions to find patterns. Then, using SQL to find more patterns. Finally, the EDA process ended with data visualization using scatter plots, line plots, bar charts, and Folium to map the data. </br>
## Summary of all results
The results that came out of all the previous process was that many factors go into determining if the Falcon 9 first stage landing will be successful. Some of these factors include the payload mass, the flight number (recent flights are more successful), etc. Overall, a lot of factors must be looked at before deciding if a flight will be successful and a decision should only be made once all those factors are taken into consideration. </br>
